# {{ page.title }}

## I develop programs and models to solve real-world problems in <span class="emphasis-inverted">software engineering</span>, <span class="emphasis-inverted">data science</span>, and <span class="emphasis-inverted">financial management</span>.

My work bridges theory, engineering, and impact-driven deliverables—grounded in a deep academic foundation in mathematics and statistics, and shaped by industry contributions in applied scientific methods, machine learning, operations research, and full-stack development.

I also serve in an accounting capacity when a project requires strict double-entry bookkeeping compliant with GAAP.
