subtitle: Data Science • ML Engineering • Solutions Architecture
abstract: "I build systems that connect mathematics, machine learning, and real-world problems. My projects range from fine-tuning LLMs and building predictive models, to designing custom data solutions that speed up decision-making.
<br><br>I started in data analytics, working with statistics, regression models, PCA, and Monte Carlo methods to tackle optimization and prediction problems. Today, I lead end-to-end development: designing scalable architectures, implementing infrastructure, and delivering tailored ML solutions.
<br><br>Each project is a chance to push boundaries and make the next challenge easier to solve — and that’s what keeps me hooked.
<br><br>See below to contact me for professional inquiries."
mission: I am a natural problem-solver and enjoy tackling the ever-growing challenges of the real world by continuously learning new technologies and applying scientific principles to them.
principle: As a self-motivated collaborator and engineer, I often identify new project goals, define scopes, and deliver minimum viable products that support strategic decisions and drive progress in production pipelines.
environment: With a strong foundation in statistics and mathematics, I enjoy working on projects involving—though not limited to—data science, artificial intelligence, operations research, operating systems development, and security.
