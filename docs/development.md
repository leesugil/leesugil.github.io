subtitle: Data Science, Software Engineering
mission: I am a natural problem-solver and enjoy tackling the ever-growing challenges of the real world by continuously learning new technologies and applying scientific principles to them.
principle: As a self-motivated collaborator and engineer, I often identify new project goals, define scopes, and deliver minimum viable products that support strategic decisions and drive progress in production pipelines.
environment: With a strong foundation in statistics and mathematics, I enjoy working on projects involving—though not limited to—data science, artificial intelligence, operations research, operating systems development, and security.

I’m a full-stack data scientist and software engineer who applies core mathematical, statistical, and scientific principles to real-world problems. I enjoy working with numbers and signals, and since completing my Ph.D., I’ve contributed to a range of industry projects across multiple domains.

As a senior data scientist, I model data for forecasting and help secure the data infrastructure that makes those models actionable. I apply classification, regression, simulation, and machine learning techniques to analyze data directly tied to key productivity areas in operations research—such as cost analysis, inventory, logistics, project budgeting, manufacturing, and financing.

As a software engineer, I develop and deploy internal management platforms. My work involves cloud-based, containerized environments and focuses on building data pipelines and processing infrastructure. These efforts aim to optimize existing workflows and lay the groundwork for long-term scalability and measurable productivity gains.

In my spare time, I enjoy studying operating systems, processor architecture, quantum computing, and post-quantum cryptography.
