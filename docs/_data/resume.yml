  - title: Galois Module Structure of Weakly Ramified Covers of Curves
    position: Dissertation
    institution: Michigan State University
    year: 2020
    abstract: The main theme of our study is the obstruction to the existence of a normal integral basis for certain Galois modules of geometric origin. When \\(G\\) is a finite group acting on a projective scheme \\(X\\) over \\(Spec\\ \\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a \\(G\\)-equivariant coherent sheaf of \\(\mathcal{O}_X\\)-modules, the sheaf cohomology groups \\(H_i(X, \\mathcal{F})\\) are \\(G\\)-modules, and one asks if its equivariant Euler characteristic \\(\\chi(X, \\mathcal{F})\\) can be calculated using a bounded complex of finitely generated free modules over \\(Z[G]\\). Then we say that the cohomology of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has a normal integral basis. The obstruction to the existence of a normal integral basis has been of great interest in the classical case of number fields. Our aim is to generalize the theory on a finite tamely ramified Galois extension \\(N/\\mathbb{Q}\\) with Galois group \\(G\\) to the simplest kind of wild ramification, namely to weakly ramified covers of curves over \\(Spec\\ \\mathbb{Z}\\).

# Industrial Projects
  - title: System Deployment & Module Development 
    position: Systems Engineer
    location: Atlanta, GA
    year: 2024 -- Present
    abstract: Defined the scope and architecture of an internal enterprise system, implemented it using open-source frameworks and databases while adhering to license constraints. Developed custom modules, deployed the system to a containerized AWS environment using Docker, and established RESTful API integrations with partner servers to automate HR and financial operations. The system reduced payroll and invoicing processing time by over 85% for a 600-employee operation, streamlined multi-state compliance workflows, and alleviated recurring operational bottlenecks.

    abstract: Restored and modernized a mission-critical manufacturing subsystem in a 60,000 sqft facility supporting a $17M project, following the abrupt exit of the operations manager. Self-trained on legacy CAD and laser-cutting systems to prevent downtime and maintain continuity for a 40-person production team. Built and deployed an internal web platform to centralize documentation, training, and progress tracking—establishing a sustainable framework for operations and onboarding. The solution prevented a factory shutdown, eliminated a $120K/year single point of failure, and safeguarded key contractual deliverables.

  - title: Django-Based Internal Management Platform
    position: Systems Engineer
    location: New Orleans, LA
    year: 2022 -- 2023
    abstract: Led the development of a modular, web-based project management platform to manage 20 concurrent post-disaster construction projects (~$2M total) following Hurricane Ida. Consolidated accounting, project management, invoicing, and collections into a unified system—replacing four separate roles and saving an estimated $200K annually. Built custom tools integrating project calendars, weather data, and Google Maps APIs to support site-level logistics. The platform centralized documentation, streamlined workflows, and improved cross-project visibility in a high-pressure, resource-constrained environment.

  - title: Centralized HR Data Pipeline for Real-Time Reporting
    position: Software Engineer (Infrastructure Tools)
    year: 2021
    abstract: Built automation scripts to consolidate decentralized HR timesheet entries from 100+ employees in a 24/7 manufacturing facility into a unified database, enabling on-demand report generation, improving data consistency, and reducing reporting time by 95%.

    abstract: "The goal was to answer to the following business problem: Can we yield an estimated shipping quote quickly during the sales process of heavy, irregularly shaped products? Applied statistical data analysis and machine-learning techniques (non-linear regression analysis, PCA, DNN) on dimensions of items, sales and shipping records, and merged with APIs available from nation-wide shipping vendors to yield a deliverable model."

  - title: Process Optimization System Development 
    year: 2024 -- Present
    abstract: Defined the scope and architecture of an internal enterprise system (application layers and DB), implemented it using open-source frameworks and relational database management systems while adhering to license constraints. Developed custom modules, deployed the system to a containerized AWS environment using Docker, and established RESTful API integrations with partner servers to automate HR and financial operations. The system reduced payroll and invoicing processing time by over 85% for a 600-employee operation, streamlined multi-state compliance workflows, and alleviated recurring operational bottlenecks.

  - title: Operational Systems Recovery & Modernization
    year: 2024
    abstract: Restored and modernized a mission-critical manufacturing subsystem in a 60,000 sqft facility supporting a $17M project, following the abrupt exit of the operations manager. Self-trained on legacy CAD and laser-cutting systems to prevent downtime and maintain continuity for a 40-person production team. Built and deployed an internal web platform to centralize documentation, training, and progress tracking—establishing a sustainable framework for operations and onboarding. The solution prevented a factory shutdown, eliminated a $120K/year single point of failure, and safeguarded key contractual deliverables.

    year: 2019
    abstract: Developed a predictive model to estimate shipping costs during sales for heavy construction parts with irregular shapes. Applied statistical data analysis and machine-learning techniques (non-linear regression analysis, PCA, DNN) on dimensions of items, sales and shipping records, and merged with APIs available from nation-wide shipping vendors to yield a deliverable model.
