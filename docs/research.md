subtitle: Algebraic Geometry • Number Theory
abstract: "My doctoral research focused on algebraic geometry and number theory, where I studied the Galois module structure of sheaves on algebraic curves with group actions (weakly ramified covers).
<br><br>At Michigan State University, I taught over seven years of core calculus and differential equations courses, reaching hundreds of students across STEM majors. I also collaborated with math educators on curriculum development, including first proof-based mathematics and technology-assisted advanced calculus. My teaching was recognized with the university’s Excellence in Teaching Award.
<br><br>Before graduate school, I earned additional degrees in Statistics and Business Administration, which continue to shape my approach to applied research and industry problem-solving.
<br><br>For a detailed list of research papers, teaching history, and curriculum projects, see below to contact me."
principle: I received a Ph.D. in mathematics with a focus on algebraic geometry. My research and teaching are informed by a broader passion for algebra, geometry, topology, and number theory, which continue to shape the way I approach mathematical questions.
mission: mission
environment: I’m experienced in both traditional teaching methods and modern educational technologies, including streaming, video lectures, and visualization using open-source tools such as Python, C, JavaScript, and OBS.
