subtitle: Pushing Boundaries, Cultivating Minds
mission: My academic journey is fueled by a desire to question assumptions, explore the unknown, and empower others through education and shared inquiry.
principle: I received a Ph.D. in mathematics with a focus on algebraic geometry. My research and teaching are informed by a broader passion for algebra, geometry, topology, and number theory, which continue to shape the way I approach mathematical questions.
environment: I’m experienced in both traditional teaching methods and modern educational technologies, including streaming, video lectures, and visualization using open-source tools such as Python, C, JavaScript, and OBS.

My Ph.D. research focused on algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and number theory. Specifically, I studied the Galois module structure of sheaves arising from certain algebraic curves with group actions, known as weakly ramified covers of curves.

Prior to graduate school, I also studied statistics and business administration, building a multidisciplinary foundation.

After completing my Ph.D., I transitioned into industry—though without the intention of stepping away from academia entirely. I continue to enjoy applying mathematical and statistical methods to real-world problems and have been rediscovering the joy of applied mathematics.
