From establishing GAAP-compliant accounting practices to maintaining general ledgers and coordinating with CPAs for tax reporting and audits, I manage the full cycle of double-entry bookkeeping—from zero to one.

With a background in both business and mathematics, I have served in an accounting capacity across a variety of projects over the years. I'm comfortable working with both SMEs and large enterprises.

Technically proficient and grounded in double-entry accounting principles, I adapt easily to whichever accounting system a client uses—whether it's Oracle ERP, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics, SAP, QuickBooks, Odoo, ERPNext, GnuCash, or even spreadsheet-based workflows.

As a natural problem-solver and Ph.D.-trained mathematician, I approach accounting with high integrity—translating each client’s business activities into the correct language of the ledger.
