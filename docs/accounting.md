subtitle: Controller • Accountant • Bookkeeper
abstract: 'I help small-to-medium businesses bring structure and clarity to their finances. Many founders are experts in their products, but struggle with questions like when to hire their first bookkeeper, how to forecast cash flow, or how to present financials to investors and banks.
<br><br>That’s where I step in. I establish GAAP-compliant accounting systems, manage full-cycle financial reporting, and provide the insight business owners need to make confident decisions. From traditional family businesses and manufacturers to early-stage startups, I’ve guided companies from "zero to one" in their financial operations — ensuring compliance today while building a foundation for growth tomorrow.'
abstract2: "I have been serving small-to-medium businesses (SMB) helping them grow and manage their finance.
<br><br>From traditional family businesses to young startups, all the owners that I've met were so much passionate and knowledgeable with their product. Yet it wasn't easy to tell when they should start hiring a dedicated bookkeeper or learn to forecast business cashflow, or even talk to bankers with their balance sheet. And financial reports seem to remain fearful to them for a long time.
<br><br>And I personally felt this is how I can give back to the community all the support that I received through my education.
<br><br>I serve in an accounting capacity for businesses that can benefit from having one for the first time. From establishing GAAP-compliant accounting practices to financial reporting, I manage the full cycle of accounting—from zero to one."
mission: I bring clarity and confidence to complex financial decisions—ensuring accountability, long-term stability, and smart resource allocation.
principle: Grounded in U.S. GAAP standards, I deliver accounting services and financial reporting aligned with professional integrity and business relevance.
environment: Using any platform such as SAP, Oracle, Sage, QuickBooks, Odoo, ERPNext, NetSuite, or GNUCash, along with data-processing tools like Python Pandas, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Excel, I collaborate effectively with stakeholders across diverse industries and cultural backgrounds—from small businesses to international teams—adapting financial workflows to meet each organization's unique needs.
