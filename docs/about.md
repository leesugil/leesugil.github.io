I love learning and solving problems. I've always been attracted to incomprehensible complexities and challenges, and it's the core drive of my day-to-day contribution to the real-world. I write code and books for my employers, teams, and people who which to push boundaries and can benefit from my expriences. The current related fields are machine learning, data science, data engineering, IT infrastructure, and financial management.

Before the industrial profession, I studied algebraic geometry and number theory. My dissertation focus was on studying a specific type of curves and its ramification behavior under a group action. I'm hoping to be able to get my hands on the subject again, but my current priority is to follow my contribution.
