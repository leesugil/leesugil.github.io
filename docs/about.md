abstract: "
I love learning and solving problems. I‚Äôve always been drawn to complex challenges, and this drive fuels my work as both an engineer and researcher.
<br><br>My journey began in Korea, where the education system often rewarded perfection on transcripts more than curiosity. For years, I pushed myself to meet expectations while quietly questioning whether I could pursue what truly fascinated me. After military service, that curiosity reignited through studying statistical models in economics, which opened doors to physics and ultimately to mathematics.
<br><br>A one-year exchange program in the U.S. convinced me that science was not just an interest, but my calling. I later returned to the U.S. to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics and teach for several years. Along the way, I discovered that knowledge becomes most powerful when shared. Remembering how difficult mathematics once felt to me, I‚Äôve worked to bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical tools‚Äîwhether through research, writing, or code.
<br><br>As industry needs evolved, so did my path. In the era of big data, I focused on analytics and predictive modeling. Today, my focus is on machine learning engineering and applied AI, with an eye toward emerging fields that will shape the post-AI era. For me, learning never stops‚Äîit is both my profession and my passion.
